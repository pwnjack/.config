# Merge the tracked Claude Code settings (claude/settings.json) into
# ~/.claude/settings.json, leaving every other key in that file alone.
#
# The live file cannot be a tracked symlink: Claude Code, plugins and Herdr all
# write into it, often with absolute machine paths. So the tracked copy holds
# only the settings authored here and is merged in: objects merge key by key,
# and each tracked hook group is appended after removing, from the live groups,
# only the hooks that run the same script (matched by file name) — other hooks
# sharing a group survive, a group left empty is dropped, re-running never
# duplicates a hook, and a stale absolute-path copy of it is replaced. Idempotent, and a no-op when Claude
# Code is not installed.
