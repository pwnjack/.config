# Resolve a Codex model alias and reasoning effort to launch arguments, at
# delegation time, from Codex's own model catalogue. An alias is a model
# codename — the Codex analogue of Claude's "sonnet" — and always means the
# newest listed model of that name, so a new generation is picked up with no
# edit. No full slug is written here.
#
#   codex-model.sh <alias> <effort>
#     alias:  a codename (e.g. sol, terra, luna) | inherit
#     effort: low | medium | high | xhigh
#   codex-model.sh --is-expensive <alias-or-slug>
#
# stdout, one line each: the model slug (empty for inherit), then the effort
# actually used. The reason for any adjustment or failure goes to stderr.
# Exit: 0 resolved, 2 usage, 3 not resolvable — the caller degrades to inherit.
# --is-expensive exits 0 for an opt-in-only model, 1 otherwise; it needs no
# catalogue, so it cannot fail open.
#
# Naming. Only models with visibility "list" and a string slug count, and a
# trailing -YYYY-MM-DD is ignored. A slug's generation is everything through
# its first segment holding a digit ("gpt-N" in "gpt-N-name-mini"); its
# codename is the segment after that ("name"). A slug without a version
# segment has no codename.
#
# Resolution. Among listed models with the alias as codename, take the highest
# generation version; prefer the plain "<generation>-<alias>" over variants
# (-mini, -pro) and over dated snapshots, then the lowest priority. No listed
# model of that name exits 3.
#
# Opt-in only. EXPENSIVE lists the codenames the user reserves for explicit
# requests; a snapshot or variant of one (name-pro, name-2031-01-01) counts as
# it. When Codex ships a new flagship codename, add it here — one word.
#
# Effort. Clamped down to the highest level the model lists at or below the
# request; failing that, up to its lowest listed delegate level. A model that
# lists no levels gets the request unchanged. "ultra" enables automatic task
# delegation and is refused outright; "max" is outside the delegate vocabulary.
