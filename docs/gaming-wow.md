# WoW / Battle.net on this setup

## Current working baseline (2026-09-12)

Use **Battle.net from Rofi**, which runs
`env LUTRIS_SKIP_INIT=1 lutris lutris:rungameid/3`. Keep Lutris as the primary
launcher: the user reports better cursor behavior here than in Faugus. The
previous Faugus migration was stopped; the desktop shortcut was never changed.

The current chain is Rofi -> Lutris -> Gamescope (SDL) -> UMU/Proton ->
Battle.net -> WoW. Lutris's game configuration is machine-local:
`~/.local/share/lutris/games/battlenet-standard-1762118986.yml`. It uses the
existing `~/Games/battlenet` prefix and `Proton-GE Latest` runner.

Current Gamescope settings in that Lutris entry:

```yaml
gamescope: true
gamescope_flags: --backend sdl --expose-wayland --force-grab-cursor -r 144 --adaptive-sync
gamescope_game_res: 2560x1440
gamescope_output_res: 2560x1440
gamescope_window_mode: -b
```

Only the backend was changed from `wayland` to `sdl` during troubleshooting.
The user confirmed resizing worked, initially reported unclickable controls,
then reported the retry worked and asked to retain this setup. Disabling
Gamescope was prepared but never applied. Existing Lutris environment and
runner overrides remain intact; there is no verified reason to copy the
different Faugus overrides into this baseline.

Battle.net now opens centered at **1920x1080** instead of 1280x720 on the
2560x1440 monitor. This is the outer window size; Gamescope's internal game
resolution remains 2560x1440. WoW retains its fullscreen/workspace-5 rules.
When a shared Gamescope window leaves fullscreen, returning to its previous
launcher-sized geometry is expected. This does not by itself indicate that
the fullscreen game was rendering at that smaller resolution.

Live verification after the size change: Battle.net opened floating and
centered at 1920x1080; WoW subsequently appeared with initial title
`World of Warcraft`, fullscreen at 2560x1440 on workspace 5. Hyprland reported
no configuration errors. Keep testing through this one launch path: camera
dragging, Super+workspace switching and repeated fullscreen/resize cycles still
need user confirmation before treating gameplay as fully verified.

The monitor exposes VRR support, but Hyprland currently has `misc.vrr = 0`
and `general.allow_tearing = false`. Neither `--adaptive-sync` nor the
`immediate` window rule proves VRR/tearing is active. Leave display tuning
separate from these input/window tests.

## Historical Faugus recipe

Hard-won launch tuning that this repo **cannot** track directly. `.gitignore`
ignores `faugus-launcher/**`, and rightly so: Faugus rewrites `games.json` on
every session (`playtime` alone churns), and the directory also holds absolute
paths, banners, icons and the BattlEye/EAC blobs. So the recipe lives here as
prose instead. A fresh `./install.sh` restores the Hyprland half automatically
and needs this file to rebuild the rest by hand.

Verified 2026-07-26 against gamescope 3.16.24, faugus-launcher 2.0.2, umu
1.4.1-patch1, GE-Proton11-1, Hyprland 0.56.0.

### The Faugus launch chain

Four hops, which is why the window rules have to match two different clients:

```
Faugus Launcher -> env vars -> gamescope -> Battle.net.exe -> WoW
```

Faugus entry `Battle.net`, prefix `~/Games/battlenet`, runner `Proton-GE Latest`
(`~/.local/share/Steam/compatibilitytools.d/Proton-GE Latest`, GE-Proton11-1
at the July verification). `launch_arguments`, verbatim:

```
WINE_SIMULATE_WRITECOPY=1 PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=0 gamescope -w 2560 -h 1440 -W 2560 -H 1440 -r 144 --backend sdl --expose-wayland --force-grab-cursor --adaptive-sync --
```

Plus `envar.txt`: `DISABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=1` (now stored in
`~/.config/faugus-launcher/envar.json`; games are now in
`~/.local/share/faugus-launcher/games.json`).

Why each piece is there:

- **`--force-grab-cursor`** — the one that took the longest to find. Without it,
  click-and-dragging to swing the camera lets the pointer cross out of the game
  viewport, which drops Hyprland focus and stops the camera mid-turn. It ruins
  combat. Paired with `ClipCursor "1"` in-game (see below); both halves are
  needed.
- **`--backend sdl`** — nested backend rather than DRM, so gamescope stays a
  normal Hyprland client instead of taking the display.
- **`--adaptive-sync`** — historical VRR intent; see the current-baseline
  caveat above. This flag alone does not enable Hyprland's monitor VRR.
- **`-w 2560 -h 1440 -W 2560 -H 1440 -r 144`** — matches the measured
  2560x1440, 144 Hz panel. These are machine-local dimensions; the tracked
  `hypr/config/hardware/monitor.lua` is host-neutral. Adjust them for a
  different monitor.
- **`--expose-wayland`** — lets the nested client see the Wayland socket.
- **`PROTON_ENABLE_WAYLAND=0` + `DISABLE_GAMESCOPE_WSI=1`** — keep the game on
  XWayland inside gamescope rather than native Wayland, and stop Proton's
  gamescope WSI layer from fighting the nested compositor.
- **`WINE_SIMULATE_WRITECOPY=1`** — Battle.net launcher stability.
- Faugus's own `gamemode=False` and `mangohud=False`, globally and per-game.
  Deliberate; see "Measured and rejected" below.

Known wart: `games.json` sets `addapp_bat` to
`.../Battle.net/faugus-battlenet.bat`, and that file does not exist. Harmless
leftover, but don't be surprised by it.

## The Hyprland half (tracked)

`hypr/config/software/rules.lua`, under `Game window rules`. Each effect is
applied to two named rule tables by `game_rule()` — one matching
`class (?i)^WowClassic[.]exe$` and one matching `class ^(gamescope)$`, title
`^World of Warcraft( [(]grabbed[)])?$` — because with the gamescope wrapper it is
*gamescope* that is the Hyprland client, not the game. Both Classic clients
report the same `WowClassic.exe`, so one pair covers both.

Matching correction (2026-09-12): executable classes are matched
case-insensitively with literal dots. The Gamescope launcher title matches
`^Battle[.]net.*$`, covering the observed initial `Battle.net Login` as well as
`Battle.net`; Hyprland uses full regex matches, so the old `^(Battle.net)`
missed the login window. The WoW title also accepts Gamescope's optional
` (grabbed)` suffix. Both Battle.net rules also set the outer launcher size to
1920x1080. The WoW rule effects remain unchanged. Rofi's existing Battle.net
shortcut invokes Lutris with the SDL backend; see the current baseline.

Floating, size, workspace and fullscreen rules apply when a window opens.
Restart Battle.net to test the corrected startup match. If Gamescope reuses
that window and changes its title to WoW, the dynamic game effects can match,
but the startup-only fullscreen/workspace effects will not run again. Handling
that transition requires a separate title-event handler; none is added by this
rule update.

- **`immediate on`** — retained from the historical stutter tuning. It allows
  tearing for the window only when compositor-wide tearing is also enabled;
  the current `general.allow_tearing = false` prevents that.
- **`no_blur`, `no_shadow`, `decorate off`** — stop the compositor spending
  anything on effects behind a fullscreen game.
- **`workspace 5` + `fullscreen on`** — the game gets its own workspace, so
  `$Mod+1..4` still flips to a browser without disturbing it.
- **`idle_inhibit fullscreen`** — added 2026-07-26. Nothing in the
  wine/gamescope chain sends an idle inhibit, so `hypridle` would fire
  `hyprlock` at its 305s timeout over a fullscreen game during a cutscene,
  flight path or queue. The mode is `fullscreen`, not `always`, so switching to
  a browser workspace restores the normal lock timer immediately.

The rule name is **`idle_inhibit`**, with an underscore. Hyprland 0.56 rejects
`idleinhibit` as `invalid field type`. It validates its mode
(`none|always|focus|fullscreen`) and errors on anything else — unlike the
neighbouring `content` rule, which accepts any string including `bogus`, so
`content game` cannot be assumed to do anything without measuring it.

## Deliberate in-game CVars

`Config.wtf` lives per client under
`~/Games/battlenet/drive_c/Program Files (x86)/World of Warcraft/<client>/WTF/`,
where `<client>` is `_classic_era_` or `_anniversary_`. WoW rewrites the whole
file on exit, so **edit it only while the game is closed**, and back it up first.

Most of the file is churn — `CACHE-*`, `engineSurvey*`, `gameTip`, quest counts,
`lastAddonVersion`. Ignore all of it. These are the settings that were chosen:

| CVar | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `ClipCursor` | `1` | In-game half of the camera-drag fix; pairs with `--force-grab-cursor` |
| `GxCompatWorkSubmitOptimizations` | `0` | vkd3d/D3D12 work-submit stutter workaround |
| `GxApi` | `D3D12` | D3D12 via vkd3d-proton rather than D3D11 |
| `hwDetect` | `0` | Stops WoW's auto-detect from overwriting these choices on launch |
| `vsync` | `1` | Retained historical setting; not evidence that monitor VRR is active |
| `GxMaximize` | `1` | Fullscreen behaviour inside the gamescope surface |
| `graphicsQuality` | `6` | Quality preset, with the individual knobs below overriding it |
| `shadowMode` / `shadowTextureSize` / `shadowNumCascades` | `3` / `2048` / `3` | Shadow detail |
| `SSAO` | `3` | Ambient occlusion |
| `reflectionMode` | `0` | Reflections off — costly, little visual gain here |
| `worldBaseMip` | `0` | Full-resolution world textures |
| `maxFPSBk` | `60` | Background FPS cap (`_classic_era_` only) |

`RAID*` and `raidGraphics*` duplicates of these exist and are set to match, so
raid encounters don't silently drop to a different profile.

**Both clients must be kept in sync.** On 2026-07-26 `_classic_era_` was missing
`ClipCursor` and `GxCompatWorkSubmitOptimizations` — the two hardest-won fixes
were only ever applied to `_anniversary_`. Both were added to `_classic_era_`
(backup at `Config.wtf.bak-20260726`). When tuning one client, apply it to the
other.

## Measured and rejected

Recorded so this ground isn't re-covered. All measured on this machine
(i7-9700K, RTX 3080 Ti, desktop, no battery) on 2026-07-26.

**`gamemode` — not worth wiring up.** Running `gamemoderun sleep 8` and watching
what actually changed:

| Claimed effect | Reality here |
|---|---|
| CPU governor -> performance | No-op. Governor stays `powersave`; `intel_pstate` is in **active** mode, so gamemode won't touch HWP |
| Power profile / EPP | Already `performance` — `powerprofilesctl` is pinned there and EPP reads `performance` |
| ioprio | Not applied (`none: prio 0` during) |
| NVIDIA PowerMizer | Needs explicit `gpu_device`/coolbits config; the card already clocks up under load |
| renice | Applied: `nice -4` |

So the sole working effect is a scheduler priority boost, and niceness only
matters under CPU contention — with 8 cores and one heavy process there is no
contest to win. `gamemoded` is installed and running (D-Bus activated) but stays
inactive because nothing registers with it. Leave it that way.

**`power-profiles-daemon` toggle — pointless here.** Already pinned
`performance`, and `/sys/class/power_supply` is empty. On a desktop it would buy
thermals and fan noise, not battery life.

**Session-level "gaming mode" — not built, on purpose.** The idea was to hide
waybar, force swaync DND and inhibit idle whenever a game was running. It
dissolved on inspection:

- Waybar is `"layer": "bottom"` (`waybar/config.jsonc:8`) with an exclusive
  zone, so a fullscreen window already occludes it completely. Hiding it gains
  no screen space during play, and would remove the bar exactly during the
  workspace-switched moments when it's wanted.
- The real workflow is `$Mod+1..4` to a browser workspace and back, not
  alt-tabbing out of a fullscreen window. Anything scoped to "the game is
  *running*" is therefore wrong; it has to be scoped to "the game is
  *focused*". `gamemode`'s `start=`/`end=` hooks are process-lifetime only, so
  gamemode cannot express that distinction at all.
- Notification toasts over the game and mid-game `hyprlock` had never actually
  occurred in practice. The lock risk was closed by one window rule
  (`idle_inhibit fullscreen`) with no script, daemon or state file — and hence
  nothing to restore if the game crashes.

Deliberately **no `doctor.sh` check** for any of this. `games.json` is
git-ignored and machine-local, so a check would be a second source of truth and
would ERROR on any machine without Faugus installed.
