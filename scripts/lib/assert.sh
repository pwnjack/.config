# Assertions shared by the standalone test suites. Sourced, never executed.
#
# Each suite sources this, calls the assertions, and ends with
# `test_summary [name]`, whose status is the suite's exit status. The doctor's
# harness (scripts/doctor/test/run-tests.sh) keeps its own: its modules are
# sourced into one shell and share its counters and reserved names.
#
# test/test-assert.sh exercises this file on every commit, since suites under
# other directories only run when their own directory changes.
