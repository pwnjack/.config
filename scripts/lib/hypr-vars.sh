# Resolution of application names referenced by the Lua configuration.
#
# Anything that reads a config line afterwards has to resolve the application
# table the same way. Two things do:
# the doctor's binary check, which needs to know the command a keybind really
# runs, and the keybinds cheatsheet, which labels `$terminal` with the terminal
# you actually use. One copy means a new variable source is taught once.
#
# Sourced, never executed. It defines a function and nothing else, so sourcing
# it twice in one shell is harmless.
#

# hypr_var_origin <name> -> `options` or `apptype`.
#
# Which of the two sources below defines the variable. Split out so the list of
# options-backed names exists once: hypr_resolve_var needs it to know where to
# read, and the cheatsheet's markdown mode needs it to know which values are a
# per-user preference rather than a repo constant. A second copy of this list
# would be a second source of truth.

    case "$1" in
        terminal|browser|editor) printf 'options' ;;

    esac
}

# hypr_resolve_var <name> <root> -> value on stdout, empty when undefined.
#
# `name` is the bare variable name, without the leading `$`. Two sources, in
# the order the config itself establishes them:
#
#   terminal, browser,  apptype.lua reads options/<name> at parse time, so the
#   editor              option file is the value.
#   everything else     hypr/config/apptype.lua, `name = "value"`.
#
# Comments are stripped at the first `#`, which is Hyprland's own rule.
