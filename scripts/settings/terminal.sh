# Make the configured terminal (options/terminal) the one xdg-terminal-exec
# opens. That is how GLib apps (Thunar's "Open with", GTK launchers) and uwsm
# run a desktop entry with Terminal=true, such as nvim, yazi or btop; with no
# preference it picks whichever terminal it finds first.
#
# This writes ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/xdg-terminals.list naming the
# desktop entry that is a TerminalEmulator and whose Exec runs the configured
# binary; hidden helper entries and file openers are skipped, and entries are
# taken in C-locale order so the choice never depends on the locale. The list
# is per-machine state: the .gitignore whitelist leaves it untracked. A list
# without this script's first line was written by hand and is left alone; a
# terminal with no desktop entry removes this script's list, which leaves
# xdg-terminal-exec's own choice.
#
# Run by install.sh and by the settings panel when the Terminal row changes.
# Idempotent; always exits 0, because a stale list only costs Terminal=true
# entries their terminal.
