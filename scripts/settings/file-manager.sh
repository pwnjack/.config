# Make the configured file manager (options/filemanager) the one that answers
# org.freedesktop.FileManager1, the D-Bus service behind every "Show in folder":
# the capture toasts, browser downloads, portals.
#
# Several installed file managers can claim that name (Nautilus, Dolphin,
# Thunar each ship a service file for it) and D-Bus then picks one on its own,
# whatever the preference says. A user service file takes precedence over the
# system ones, so this copies the configured file manager's own service file to
# ${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/dbus-1/services/ and asks the bus to reload.
# A file manager with no such service (yazi, a TUI) removes the copy, which
# leaves the system's choice.
#
# Run by install.sh and by the settings panel when the File manager row
# changes. Idempotent; always exits 0, because a missing D-Bus service only
# costs "Show in folder" its selection.
