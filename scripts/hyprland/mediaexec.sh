# Media status for waybar, and for hyprlock with --plain.
#
# Emits JSON so the module can carry a tooltip. Built with jq because track
# titles are arbitrary text -- a quote or backslash in a song name would
# break hand-written JSON and blank the module.
#
# hyprlock labels take one line of plain text, not JSON, so it calls this with
# --plain: same icon and truncation, no tooltip, no <span> (the lock screen
# has its own font_size and does not share waybar's scale). Both modes still
# escape Pango entities -- hyprlock parses label markup exactly as waybar does.
#
# The glyph is wrapped in <span size='large'> to match the bar scale: every
# module sits at 13px and promotes its glyph by a fifth. See waybar/style.css.
# Because the markup counts toward waybar's max-length, that key is deliberately
# absent from the module config -- truncation happens here instead, on the
# rendered "Artist - Title" label.
#
# Which player is shown is decided by medialib.sh, not by a stored preference.
# All the click and scroll bindings are transport controls (mediactl.sh).
