# Shared player selection for the waybar media module. Sourced, not run.
#
# playerctl with no --player picks the first name on the bus, which is
# registration order and has nothing to do with what is playing: with Firefox
# and Spotify both open the bar would sit on whichever registered first, even
# while the other one plays. There used to be a left-click toggle that pinned
# the module to options/mediaplayer to work around exactly that; choosing the
# right player here removes the reason for the toggle.
#
# The rule, best match first:
#
#   1. Playing and has a title   -- what you actually want to see
#   2. has a title               -- paused, but real metadata to show
#   3. Playing                   -- something is making noise; name it, even
#                                   though the bar will hide an empty title
#   4. the first player on the bus
#
# Rank 1 before 2 rather than "any Playing player wins" because Spotify sits on
# the bus Playing with empty metadata in some states, and that would blank a
# bar that had a perfectly good paused title to show.
#
# Display (mediaexec.sh) and transport (mediactl.sh) both go through this, so
# the title on the bar and the player your scroll wheel moves are always the
# same one -- there is one winner, not one per surface.
#

# Field separator: ASCII unit separator, and NOT a tab.
#
# `read` collapses runs of IFS *whitespace* into one delimiter, and a tab is
# whitespace. Spotify sits on the bus with an empty title but a real artist,
# which emits two adjacent separators -- with tabs those collapse and every
# later field shifts left, so the artist is read as the title and the album as
# the artist. That is the bug that used to put "firefox" in the album slot.
# \x1f is not whitespace, so an empty field stays an empty field.
MEDIA_SEP=$'\x1f'

# One line per player. The separator has to be a real byte before playerctl
# sees it: playerctl's format language does not interpret backslash escapes,
# so a literal "\t" in the format string would come back as two characters.
