# Reporting primitives for doctor.sh checks.
#
# CONTRACT FOR CHECK MODULES:
#   Never run a check loop in a pipeline or subshell. The severity counters
#   below are plain shell variables, so `cmd | while read` increments them in
#   a subshell and every finding is silently discarded. Always write:
#       while read -r x; do ... done < <(cmd)
#   The test harness greps check modules for this pattern and fails on it.
#
#   These names are reserved by this library — check modules must not redefine
#   them: group ok err warn note summary doctor_reset doctor_q
#   doctor_require_repo _finding
#
#   Any path interpolated into a fix hint must go through doctor_q, or the hint
#   stops being copy-pasteable the moment a path contains a space.
#
#   Messages and fix hints are printed with printf %s, never echo -e, so paths,
#   grep patterns and sed commands survive verbatim (a message containing \n or
#   \t must not be rewritten). Only the colour constants get %b.
#

# Root of the dotfiles tree under test. Overridable so the test suite can point
# the checks at a throwaway fixture repo instead of the live system.
