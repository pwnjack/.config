# Host hardware truth: no tracked config names a display output that this
# machine does not have.
#
# Nothing is enumerated here. The valid set comes from the kernel, the
# occurrences come from `git ls-files -s`. A config file added tomorrow is
# covered the moment it is committed.
#
# WHY /sys/class/drm RATHER THAN hyprctl. The doctor must be runnable from a
# TTY with no compositor — that is exactly when a broken monitor config is
# worth diagnosing — and sysfs answers there. hyprctl does not.
#
# SEVERITY IS WARN, NEVER ERROR. Naming a connector that happens to be
# unplugged right now is legitimate: a docked laptop, a monitor switched off at
# the wall. The finding says the config is stale, not that the session is
# broken, and doctor.sh must not exit 1 on a machine whose session came up fine.
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT SCANNED:
#
#   *.md — README.md and QUICKSTART.md carry connector names as deliberate
#   examples of what a value looks like. This is the same reasoning that
#   already excludes docs/ from references.sh's literal-path scan.
#
#   docs/ — the specs and plans quote real connector names when recording what
#   was measured on a given machine.
#
#   scripts/doctor/ — this file's own pattern below, and its fixtures, are made
#   of connector names.
#
#   Tracked symlinks. Every one of them points into ~/.cache, where the content
#   is generated — waypaper/config.ini resolves to ~/.cache/waypaper-config.ini,
#   which is exactly where waypaper records a chosen connector. A finding there
#   would hand the user a hint telling them to edit a tracked symlink, which is
#   the opposite of this repo's cache-symlink invariant: generated state lives
#   in ~/.cache and is corrected by regenerating it, never by hand. Reporting a
#   file the user cannot correct misdirects rather than helps. The mode comes
#   from `git ls-files -s`, the same source of truth symlinks.sh derives from.
#
# Accepted limitations:
#
#   - A connector name inside a comment reads the same as one in a live
#     setting. Distinguishing them means knowing the comment syntax of every
#     tracked file type, which is a worse trade than one occasional finding on
#     a line that was already documenting the stale value.
#
#   - The pattern has no left-hand word boundary, so a token ending in a
#     connector name matches: AUDP-3 yields DP-3. Fixing it needs a lookbehind,
#     which grep -oE does not have; a (^|[^A-Za-z]) prefix would instead capture
#     the boundary character into the token and break the comparison against the
#     present set. There are zero such occurrences in this tree, so the cost of
#     the workaround exceeds the cost of the gap.

# The DRM connector namespace, as the kernel spells it in
# /usr/include/libdrm/drm_mode.h. This is upstream vocabulary — the same kind
# of constant as DOCTOR_WAYBAR_ACTIONS in waybar.sh, and stale only on a kernel
# release, never on a change to this repo.
#
# It is the subset this repo plausibly encounters, not the whole namespace of
# 21. KNOWINGLY OMITTED, none of which any machine running this tree has:
# Composite, SVIDEO, Component, 9PinDIN, TV, DPI, Writeback, SPI, USB, Unknown.
# Adding one to a config without adding it here costs a missed WARN, never a
# false one — so the list fails safe, which is why it is worth keeping narrow
# rather than speculative.
#
# Alternation order is irrelevant: grep matches leftmost, and at offset 0 of
# eDP-1 only eDP can begin a match, so eDP-1 is never read as a bare DP-1.
# DisplayPort MST (Multi-Stream Transport) carries several downstream displays
# on one physical link. DRM names each downstream branch by appending `-<N>`,
# so a connector can be DP-1-1 (and its numeric suffix can repeat further down
# a daisy chain); matching only DP-1 would both invent false warnings and hide
# stale MST names when a plain DP-1 exists.
