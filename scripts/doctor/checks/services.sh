#
# Autostart daemons, D-Bus role ownership, and install.sh package drift.
#
# Three independent probes share one module because they are the three ways
# this repo's runtime state can silently diverge from its config without any
# file going missing (which the other checks already cover):
#
#   1. Daemon list — derived from bare-binary `exec-once` lines in
#      autostart.conf, the same source binaries.sh already scans. A line is a
#      daemon candidate only when its first token has no `/`, `~/` or `$`
#      prefix: those forms name a one-shot script or an unresolved variable,
#      neither of which is "a process that should still be alive". This is
#      deliberately the same split binaries.sh uses for the identical reason.
#
#      An unquoted `~/*` case pattern is tilde-expanded to the running user's
#      home before matching, so it can never match a literal "~/" in a config
#      file — a real bug caught in the binaries.sh task and fixed the same way
#      here: quote the tilde.
#
#   2. D-Bus role ownership — DOCTOR_DBUS_ROLE names one well-known bus name
#      that only a single process can hold. Only the notification daemon is in
#      scope; scaling to more would need the variable to become a newline list
#      and the lookup below to loop over it, which is not worth building for a
#      set of one.
#
#      Which packages compete for that name is DERIVED, not listed. Every
#      program able to own a well-known bus name ships an activation file
#      under /usr/share/dbus-1/services declaring `Name=<bus-name>`, and
#      `pacman -Qoq` maps that file back to its package. Installing a third
#      notification daemon therefore extends coverage on its own.
#
#      pacman's own Provides field is deliberately NOT used. Verified on the
#      live system: `pacman -Qi mako` and `pacman -Qi swaync` both print
#      "Provides : None", so a Provides lookup finds nothing and the orphan
#      finding — the reason this section exists — would never fire.
#
#   3. Package drift — PACKAGES and AUR_PACKAGES arrays parsed out of
#      install.sh. Verified against the live file (lines 89-121): both arrays
#      close on a bare `)` at column 0 with no continuation, which is what the
#      awk state machine below assumes. If a future edit indents the closing
#      paren or puts a second array entry on that line, the parser silently
#      stops seeing members past that point — a silent under-report, not a
#      crash, and worth knowing if this check ever looks confidently wrong.
#
# Severity: a daemon not running is WARN (one feature — the thing it does —
# stops working, but the session is fine). Everything else here is INFO: who
# owns a D-Bus name, an orphaned config directory, a package drifted out of
# install.sh — all tidiness, nothing broken. Nothing in this module is ever
# ERROR: there is no daemon whose absence breaks the session itself (that is
# what binaries.sh's WARN-only stance already argues for the same targets).
#
# Accepted risks:
#
#   * The daemon-running check does not verify a matching package is
#     installed first. "Installed but not running" in the task brief is read
#     as "autostart declares it, so it is expected to be alive" rather than a
#     literal pacman cross-check — the binary-to-package name mapping is not
#     1:1 (swayosd-server ships from package "swayosd", ags from AUR package
#     "aylurs-gtk-shell") and reconstructing it is its own project. A daemon
#     that was deliberately uninstalled still gets one WARN instead of silence
#     — a known false positive, cheap to dismiss, cheaper than a wrong map.
#
#   * `pgrep -x` matches on `comm`, which the kernel truncates at 15 bytes.
#     Every name in this repo's autostart.conf is short enough that this never
#     bites (`swayosd-server` is 14 bytes, the longest of them), so no
#     workaround is implemented. `pgrep -f` was tried and rejected: it matches
#     full command lines, so `pgrep -f ags` also matched an unrelated shell
#     invocation that merely mentioned "ags" in its argv, and `-f hypridle`
#     etc. are just as porous. `-x` is the correct tool here, not a shortcut.
#
#   * `pacman`, `busctl` and `pgrep` availability are each checked once in
#      check_services before the loop that depends on them, not inside every
#      iteration — so an unavailable tool skips the whole probe silently
#      instead of one warning-shaped finding per item.
