# SSH agent wiring (scripts/ssh/setup.sh): passphrase once per login.
#
# Nothing is restated here. The socket name comes from the SSH_AUTH_SOCK line
# of hypr/config/setup/envvars.lua, and the unit name and Include line from
# scripts/ssh/setup.sh, which owns them.
#
# Every finding is a WARN: without the agent ssh still works and just asks for
# the passphrase on every use. A shell started before the setup, which lacks
# SSH_AUTH_SOCK until the next login, is only a note; so is a shell that uses
# another agent (forwarded, gpg-agent, gcr).
#
# Two details mirror setup.sh: the first line of ~/.ssh/config is compared
# without trailing whitespace (ssh ignores it, a CR included), and the tracked
# ssh/config fragment is warned about when group or world writable, because ssh
# refuses such an Include target ("Bad owner or permissions") and then every
# ssh call fails.
#
# Trees without envvars.lua, or whose file sets no SSH_AUTH_SOCK, get no output: the feature does not apply there.
