# Waybar bar integrity: every module on the bar is configured, every configured
# block is on the bar, and every command a handler invokes exists.
#
# Nothing is enumerated here. The placed modules come out of the modules-left,
# modules-center and modules-right arrays; the configured blocks come out of
# the file's own top-level keys; the commands come out of the handler values. A
# module added tomorrow is covered the moment it is committed.
#
# WHY GREP AND AWK RATHER THAN jq. config.jsonc is JSONC: jq fails on it
# outright (comments, trailing commas), and stripping comments first would
# corrupt any string containing // — a handler value can hold a URL. The file's
# own two-space top-level indent is a more reliable handle than a
# pre-processor. (_way_placed does strip //, but only inside a modules array,
# where every element is a bare module name; see the note there.)
#
# WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT REPORTED:
#
#   Handler paths under ~/.config or $HOME/.config. references.sh already scans
#   every tracked file for those, and config.jsonc is tracked, so checking them
#   here would report the same fact twice against the same file.
#
#   A built-in module placed with no config block is NOT an error. waybar
#   renders clock or cpu perfectly well on its defaults. It is still worth a
#   WARN, because it is also exactly what a typo looks like -- waybar drops an
#   unknown module name silently, so a bar missing a module looks identical to
#   a bar that never had one.
#
#   A style.css selector for every module. CSS selectors nest and group, so the
#   derivation is unreliable in a way the other two are not.
#
# SEVERITY:
#
#   A custom/* module placed with no block is an ERROR. It has no exec and no
#   format, so there is nothing for waybar to run or draw: the module is dead.
#
#   A built-in placed with no block is a WARN, per the note above.
#
#   A block placed in no modules list is INFO -- doctor.sh's header defines
#   that severity as exactly this ("tidiness -- orphaned config").
#
#   A missing handler binary is a WARN, matching references.sh: one broken
#   interaction is degradation, not a broken session, and calling it an ERROR
#   would make doctor.sh exit 1 on a machine whose bar comes up fine.
#
# Accepted limitations:
#   - A handler value containing an escaped quote is truncated at that quote.
#     No such value exists here.
#   - Only the first token of a handler is checked, so `sh -c "foo"` is checked
#     as `sh`. Checking deeper means parsing a shell command line out of JSON.
#   - The two-space indent rule assumes the file keeps its current formatting.
#     A reformat that changes top-level indentation makes the block list come
#     back empty, which shows up immediately as every placed module reported.
#   - A group/* module declares its children in a nested "modules": [...] that
#     _way_placed does not read, so every child's config block would come back
#     as a false orphan INFO. No group is used here (zero in the live config),
#     which is the only reason the claim above about tomorrow's module holds.
#

# Waybar's own action keywords. They sit exactly where a command would, and are
# NOT separable by module: hyprland/workspaces carries "on-click": "activate"
# and "on-scroll-up": "hyprctl dispatch workspace r-1" in the same block.
#
# This is upstream waybar vocabulary, not a second source of truth for anything
# in this repo, so no change here can make it stale -- only a waybar release
# can. Both failure modes are bounded and visible: a keyword added upstream and
# used here produces one false WARN, and a binary genuinely named like a
# keyword hides one real finding.
#
# Space-padded at both ends so the membership test below is one `case` rather
# than three processes — the same idiom, for the same reason, as _BIN_SEEN in
# binaries.sh.

# _way_placed <config>
# Every module name inside the modules-left/center/right arrays, sorted.
#
# Both array forms appear in this repo -- inline, as modules-left is written,
# and one-per-line, as modules-right is -- so the extractor tracks the array
# rather than matching a line shape. The key is stripped from the opening line
# before names are pulled out, so "modules-left" is not itself reported; a
# continuation line has no colon, so the strip is a no-op there.
#
# The // strip is what keeps a commented-out entry from being read as data, and
# it is safe HERE in a way a global strip would not be: inside a modules array
# every element is a bare module name, and no module name contains //. The
# module header's objection — that stripping // corrupts any string containing
# it — is about the file as a whole, where handler values are shell command
# lines that really can hold a URL. Nothing in this window can.
#
# Both symptoms this prevents are real, not hypothetical:
#   `// "custom/weather",` inside an array otherwise reports a module that is
#   not placed, and since it is a custom/* that is an ERROR — doctor.sh exiting
#   1 on a working bar, the failure references.sh argues against at length.
#   A `]` inside a comment (`// pinned, see notes[1]`) otherwise closes the
#   array early, dropping every module below it and re-reporting each of their
#   blocks as a false orphan. Testing `line` rather than `$0` is what fixes it,
#   so the comment strip has to happen before the bracket test, not after.
