# Wire the tracked SSH agent setup into this machine, so a key's passphrase is
# asked once per login: OpenSSH's socket-activated agent holds the key, and
# ssh/config (AddKeysToAgent yes) hands it over on first use. SSH_AUTH_SOCK
# is set by hypr/config/setup/envvars.lua, so every app and shell Hyprland
# launches inherits it, in the plain and the uwsm session alike.

#   scripts/ssh/setup.sh [--dry-run] [--backup-dir DIR | --no-backup]
#
# ~/.ssh lies outside this repo, so it only gets a pointer: an Include on the
# FIRST line of ~/.ssh/config. First, because ssh applies a line that follows a
# Host or Match block to that block alone. Before the file changes it is copied
# to <backup dir>/.ssh/config, as scripts/lib/deploy.sh does for every config it
# replaces; install.sh passes its own --backup-dir so one install makes one
# backup. A symlinked ~/.ssh/config belongs to someone else's dotfiles and is
# never edited. A problem there (symlink without the Include, backup already
# present) skips the config change, still runs the rest and exits 1 at the end.
# Idempotent and never interactive.
#
# Test seam: SSH_SETUP_REPO overrides the repo root (where
# hypr/config/setup/envvars.lua and ssh/ are read), so the tests can run against a private copy.
#
# checks/ssh.sh parses SSH_AGENT_UNIT and INCLUDE_LINE from this file, so keep
# each a single plain NAME="value" line. The socket name is read from the
# SSH_AUTH_SOCK line of envvars.lua; checks/ssh.sh parses it with the same sed.
