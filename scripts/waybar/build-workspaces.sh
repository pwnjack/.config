# Build the native Waybar workspace module (waybar/workspaces) and render the
# include that tells Waybar where it is.
#
# Waybar hands module_path to dlopen verbatim -- no ~ expansion -- so the
# tracked config.jsonc cannot name the library on every machine. The rendered
# include carries the absolute path, and Waybar merges it into config.jsonc's
# cffi/workspaces block key by key. "source" is for doctor.sh's staleness
# check; the module ignores both keys.
#
# Rebuilds only when the installed library's content stamp (a sha256 over the
# Makefile, the C sources and headers, and this script, beside the library as
# <lib>.sha256) is missing or differs, so install.sh and doctor.sh's fix hint
# can both run it blindly. Deleted sources, older mtimes and another
# worktree's build all change the stamp. `--check` compares only: it builds and
# writes nothing, and exits 0 when the library is current, 1 when missing or
# stale. The build runs in a temporary directory (the repository never holds
# build output), and the library is renamed into place: a running Waybar keeps
# its mapping of the old file instead of executing a half-written one.
