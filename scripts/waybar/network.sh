# Network readout for Waybar: download and upload speed while the machine is
# actually moving data (options/bar-network can instead show them always, or
# never), "Offline" when no physical interface holds a default
# route, and nothing at all otherwise. The module appearing is the notice --
# the same stateless grammar custom/updates and custom/battery use.
#
# Why not Waybar's own network module: its auto-detection follows the default
# route with the lowest metric, and Proton VPN installs an IPv6 default route
# (metric 95) through its ipv6leakintrf0 dummy, which is always "linked". The
# module tracked that dummy, so it could never report Offline and its tooltip
# never rendered. Its "interface" option matches `e*` but not `[ew]*`, so no
# one pattern names both wired and Wi-Fi. Here the interface is chosen by what
# it is -- backed by hardware (/sys/class/net/X/device) and holding a default
# route -- so no tunnel or dummy can stand in for it. A bridge over the NIC
# has no device link either; on such a host this would read Offline.
#
# Continuous: Waybar starts it once and takes one line per update. A tick is
# bash builtins only -- routes and counters come from /proc, the pause is a
# read timeout, elapsed time is $EPOCHREALTIME -- so sampling every two
# seconds spawns nothing. The one external command, `ip` for the tooltip's
# address, runs when the interface changes and once a minute after that. A
# line is printed only when it differs from the last, so an idle bar is not
# redrawn at all.
#
# NET_SYSFS and NET_PROC re-root the reads; that seam is how test-network.sh
# runs without hardware. Sourcing the file defines the functions without
# starting the loop.
#
# Glyphs are \U escapes: Nerd Font private-use characters vanish when retyped.
