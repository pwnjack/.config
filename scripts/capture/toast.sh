# saved_toast <icon> <title> <body> <file> -- a detached toast with Open and
# Show in folder, so the caller returns at once. notify-send --wait blocks
# until the toast is gone and prints the chosen action. Callers holding locks
# close those descriptors on the call, or the toast would keep them held.
#
# Show in folder asks org.freedesktop.FileManager1, which
# scripts/settings/file-manager.sh points at the configured file manager, to
# select the file; without that service it opens the folder instead.
