#
# Pywal fan-out driver.
#
# Every themed component owns an `apply_wal_colors.sh` sitting next to its own
# config. This script discovers them by glob rather than by list, so adding a
# themed component is one new file — no edit here, none in wall.sh, none in
# install.sh. A hand-written list of components would be a second source of
# truth and would drift, exactly as the doctor's checks avoid.
#
# Contract every apply script must honour:
#
#   1. It renders into ~/.cache/wal/ and never writes a tracked file. Tracked
#      files must not change at runtime; the repo tracks only a stable symlink
#      into the cache.
#   2. It always leaves its output file existing, falling back to hardcoded
#      defaults when the pywal input is missing. A tracked symlink whose
#      target does not exist is an ERROR in doctor.sh, and on a fresh checkout
#      the cache is empty.
#   3. It is idempotent, and a no-op when its component is not installed.
#   4. Reloading a running consumer is its own job — this driver knows nothing
#      about swaync-client, SIGUSR2, or any other component detail.
#
# Scripts run sequentially. They are cheap, and serial output keeps a failure
# attributable to the component that caused it.
#
# The exit status is always 0. install.sh runs under `set -e`, so a component
# that fails on one machine must not abort an otherwise good install — the
# failure is reported on stderr instead.
