# Route Spotify through scripts/spotify/launch.sh, which keeps SpotX (and
# Spicetify, when set up) applied across spotify-launcher's client updates.

#   scripts/spotify/setup.sh [--dry-run]
#
# It writes a per-user copy of spotify-launcher's desktop entry under the same
# id, with Exec pointed at the wrapper. The same id is what makes it win over
# the system copy everywhere: Rofi, and the x-scheme-handler/spotify default,
# which names spotify-launcher.desktop. Skipped when spotify-launcher is not
# installed. Idempotent and never interactive.
#
# Test seams: SPOTIFY_SETUP_REPO (the repo root), SPOTIFY_DESKTOP_SRC (the
# system entry), XDG_DATA_HOME; spotify-launcher and zip are looked up on PATH.
