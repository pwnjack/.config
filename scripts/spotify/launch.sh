#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Start Spotify through spotify-launcher, re-applying SpotX (ad blocking) and,
# when it is set up, Spicetify on top, whenever the client is unpatched.
#
#   scripts/spotify/launch.sh [URI]
#
# The desktop entry written by setup.sh runs this instead of spotify-launcher.
#
# spotify-launcher unpacks each update into a new directory and swaps it in
# whole (src/extract.rs, atomic_swap), which drops any patch. MARKER lives in
# that directory, so it disappears exactly when the patch does: its absence is
# the one signal that patching is needed. It sits beside the binary, not in
# Apps/: Spicetify's restore and apply both delete and rebuild Apps/ whole.
#
# Order matters. SpotX patches the stock Apps/xpui.spa; Spicetify then backs up
# that patched file (clearing its own stale backup, which it does whenever the
# client is backupable) and unpacks it. A client Spicetify has already unpacked
# has no xpui.spa, which SpotX refuses, so `spicetify restore` runs first then.
# SpotX gets -f: when its own backup exists it restores the stock files and
# patches again, so a run SpotX failed halfway is simply repeated.
#
# MARKER means "SpotX applied", and is written as soon as it is. Rebuilding
# Apps/ drops SpotX's stock xpui.bak, so a client that has been through
# Spicetify cannot be patched again: Spicetify's backup is the patched copy,
# and SpotX refuses it ("Detected SpotX-Bash but no backup file"). A Spicetify
# failure therefore gets its own toast naming its fix, and is not retried.
#
# SpotX exits 0 on a client newer than it supports, applying what still
# matches; the versions it logs are compared so that case gets a warning.
#
# SpotX runs `pkill -9 '[sS]potify'`, which matches process names: this file
# must never be named with "spotify" in it, or SpotX kills it mid-patch.
#
# Patching never blocks Spotify: on any failure it starts unpatched, with a
# toast naming the log. A running Spotify is never updated or patched; the call
# is handed to it as is (its single instance takes the URI). That check runs
# only while holding the lock: before it, a sibling launch's own update
# (spotify-launcher --no-exec) would look like a running client.
#
# Test seams: SPOTIFY_INSTALL_DIR (the client directory), SPOTX_URL, and the
# commands spotify-launcher, spicetify, curl, pgrep and notify-send on PATH.
