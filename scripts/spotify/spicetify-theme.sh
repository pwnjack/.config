# Select the Pywal Spicetify theme and its live-recolour extension, once.
#
#   scripts/spotify/spicetify-theme.sh
#
# Spicetify keeps its choices in its own config-xpui.ini, which the repo does
# not track, so this records them there: current_theme Pywal, color_scheme
# pywal, and pywal-live.js among the extensions. Run by install.sh; skipped
# without spicetify or before Spicetify has written its config. Idempotent:
# spicetify itself never lists an extension twice.
#
# It does not apply anything to the client. Spotify's wrapper
# (scripts/spotify/launch.sh) applies the configured theme on its next patch,
# and on an already patched client spicetify/apply_wal_colors.sh's refresh
# does; the extension itself needs one `spicetify apply` and a Spotify
# restart, which this prints.
#
# Its file name must not contain "spotify": SpotX runs pkill '[sS]potify'.
