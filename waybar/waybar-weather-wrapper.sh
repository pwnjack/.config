# Wrapper for waybar-weather: waits for the network, then streams the
# service's output to waybar line by line, and always emits valid JSON so
# waybar never renders a broken module.
#
# waybar-weather is a long-running service, not a one-shot command: it
# prints a line as soon as it has data (well under a second) and another on
# every update, and never exits on its own. Running it per interval under
# `timeout` meant waybar only saw the first line when the timeout killed it,
# ten seconds after every start. The module is therefore continuous (no
# "interval" in config.jsonc); "restart-interval" brings it back if the
# service dies.
#
# It also swaps waybar-weather's colour emoji for monochrome Nerd Font
# glyphs. The emoji were the only colour glyphs on an otherwise monochrome
# bar, and being bitmap emoji they ignore the pywal palette entirely.
# Mapped bar glyphs are wrapped in <span size="large"> (see `large` below)
# to match the bar scale (13px base, glyph promoted by a fifth) -- see waybar/style.css.
#
# An unmapped condition keeps its emoji rather than being replaced by a
# generic glyph: showing the wrong weather is worse than showing a
# mismatched one, and a stray emoji makes the gap visible so it can be
# added here.
