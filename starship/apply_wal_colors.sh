# Render the starship prompt config with the pywal palette substituted in.
#
# starship has no include mechanism and no way to point one config at another,
# so the whole file is templated: starship/starship.toml.in holds the real
# content with @colorN@ / @oncolorN@ tokens, and ~/.config/starship.toml is a
# symlink to the copy rendered here. No tracked file changes at runtime.
#
# There is nothing to reload — starship re-reads its config on every prompt,
# so an open shell picks up a new wallpaper's colors at the next prompt.
