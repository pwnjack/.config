# Hyprland Dotfiles

A complete, ready-to-use Hyprland desktop for Arch Linux and CachyOS. Its
colors follow your wallpaper: change the wallpaper and the bar, launcher,
notifications, terminal and lock screen all re-theme themselves.

## Install

On a fresh Arch Linux or CachyOS system, logged in as your normal user:

```bash
sudo pacman -S --needed git
git clone https://github.com/pwnjack/.config.git ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
./install.sh
```

The installer asks before installing packages and backs up any file it
replaces; `./install.sh --dry-run` previews everything first. It also starts an
SSH agent, so your key's passphrase is asked once per login. CachyOS ships the
`paru` AUR helper it uses; on plain Arch, install `paru` or `yay` first.

When it finishes, log out and choose **Hyprland** at your login screen — or, if
you have no login manager, type `start-hyprland` in the console.

## What's inside

- **Colours that follow the wallpaper**: Hyprland, Hyprlock, Waybar, Rofi,
  notifications, Ghostty, Neovim, btop, Discord (Vesktop), Zen Browser and
  Spotify all re-theme when the wallpaper changes, open windows included
  (Zen at its next launch).
- **Settings panel** for displays, sound, network, bar layout, power, date and
  region, startup apps and more, without editing config files.
- **Capture bar** for screenshots and screen recording, with annotation.
- **Wallpaper carousel**, a searchable **keybindings overlay**, and an
  **update card** that runs system updates from the bar.
- **Native workspace dots** on the bar, with smooth animation.
- **`./doctor.sh`** checks the live system against the config and tells you
  what is broken and how to fix it.
