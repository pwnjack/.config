#
# Reports findings at three severities and never modifies anything:
#   ERROR  the session is broken or will break on next login
#   WARN   degraded — a keybind does nothing, a daemon did not start
#   INFO   tidiness — orphaned config, package drift
#
# Exits 1 if any ERROR was found, otherwise 0.
#
# Deliberately NOT `set -e`, unlike install.sh. A check returning non-zero must
# not abort the run: the whole point is to collect every finding and still
# print a summary. Errors are tracked by counter, not by exit status.
