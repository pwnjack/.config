# Render the pywal palette as the colour scheme of the Pywal Spicetify theme,
# and push it into a patched Spotify client.
#
# The tracked spicetify/Themes/Pywal/color.ini is a symlink to the file written
# here, so no tracked file changes at runtime. Spicetify reads only hex in
# color.ini, so the readability clamps the CSS themes do with relative colours
# are done here with wal_oklch: surfaces stay in the same dark band as Vesktop
# and Zen, the accent at Spotify-green lightness (its black play icon sits on
# it), and text keeps Spotify's own white and grey. The volume and progress
# bars draw their empty part as the text colour at 30%, so filled and empty
# always differ.
#
# `spicetify refresh` copies the colours into the client without restarting
# it, and the pywal-live extension swaps them into a running Spotify. Refresh
# runs only while Pywal is the selected theme (scripts/spotify/spicetify-theme.sh
# selects it once; another choice is left alone), only on a client Spicetify
# has unpacked, and never alongside scripts/spotify/launch.sh's patch run: it
# shares that run's lock. When a patch holds it, a detached waiter refreshes
# once the patch is done, because the patch may already have applied the
# previous colours.
